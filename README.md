/\* Notes

    In computing, a parser is one of the components in an interpreter or
    compiler that checks for correct syntax and builds a data structure
    (often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree or other hierarchical structure)
    implicit in the input tokens.

    if (side1 is equal to side2 AND side 2 is equal to side3) {equalitateral}

    if (side1 is equal to side2 AND side 2 doesn't equal to side3) {isosceles}

    if (side1 doesn't equal to side2 AND side2 doesn't equal to side 3 AND side 3 doesn't equal side 1) {scalene}
